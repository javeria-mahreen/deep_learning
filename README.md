# Fruit and Vegetable Classification 

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to classify images of fruits and vegetables into 131 different categories using deep learning techniques. The model aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying various fruits and vegetables from images. This problem is crucial for applications like automated sorting systems in agriculture and food industries.

## Explanation

In this project, we used a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The model was trained using the **Fruits-360** dataset, which contains over 90,000 images of 131 classes of fruits and vegetables.

The process includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation to enhance the training set and prevent overfitting.
- Building a custom CNN model, followed by training and evaluation.
- Achieving high accuracy using the CNN model to classify fruit and vegetable images.
